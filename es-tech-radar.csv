Lightweight approach to RFCs,	Adopt,	Techniques,	FALSE,	<p>A Request for Comments (RFC) is a formal document that includes context-dependent design and architectural ideas to facilitate team collaboration and decision-making. Nearly all digital native and scaleup organizations use RFCs to capture decisions around design, architecture, techniques and the ways their teams collaborate. Mature organizations have used RFCs in autonomous teams to drive better communication and collaboration, especially in cross-team decision-making. They're often used as a process to review and ratify <a href="/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records">architecture decision records</a>. The result is a transparent collaborative process that allows those affected by a decision the chance to weigh in and provide input before the decision is ratified. So often in fast-moving environments, the reasoning leading up to design decisions gets lost along the way and teams who are responsible for implementing the decision are left scratching their heads. An RFC provides a decision audit record that benefits future team members and captures the technical and business evolution of an organization. An RFC can be a valuable tool for facilitating <a href="/radar/techniques/evolutionary-architecture">evolutionary architecture</a>. For the best outcome, though, we recommend taking a <strong><em>lightweight</em> approach to RFCs</strong>. If not narrowly scoped and to the point, these documents tend to grow in length over time and start resembling traditional solution architecture documents that are filed away and forgotten.</p>
